## Todo

- How to undo the changes according to events?
- As Michael found, `seal`, `freeze` & `preventExtensions`  all trigger `preventExtensions` and `defineProperty`.
    - should support defineProperty?
    - advanced feature, hold on
    - definedProperty doesn't support parameter receiver. But we can save the receiver in `handler.get` & `handler.set`
- Similar concept: https://github.com/nx-js/observer-util
    - It doesn't use RxJS
- Can we replace array with completely new arr instead? (instead of in-place unshift and splice ...etc)
    - it might be even slower
- There seem to be tooooo many GETs when changing an array
    - issue resolved? especially we are now using transaction
- Change for faster equals/uniq library?
    - fastequal
    - benchmark first
- Not all events need id
    - but now id is really cheap
- removeDuplicateEvents 可能是没必要的。 只要 set 和 get 在出现重复的 event id 的时候统一都取短的那个， 就能解决重复刷新的问题。
- Does transaction events property need to include stale$ in addition to set$ and delete$.
    - I guess yes, when we allow user to do freeform transaction
    - If only transaction with array methods, there is no need to, because those methods should be atomic. It won't cause any stale in the middle.
- Some ramda function causes us to monitor lots of useless gets$, especially `@@functional/placeholder`
    - It's OK for users to use Ramda, but this library uses ramda which causes unecessary performance penalty.
        - for example, toJSON method.
        - Maybe it's better not to use ramda in this library
            - Try to use less, just for performance reason
