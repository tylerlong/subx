## Todo

- get rid of ramda
- Support Symbol as prop
- Use generics in TS types
- Review TS types
- How to undo the changes according to events?
- As Michael found, `seal`, `freeze` & `preventExtensions`  all trigger `preventExtensions` and `defineProperty`.
    - should support defineProperty?
    - advanced feature, hold on
    - definedProperty doesn't support parameter receiver. But we can save the receiver in `handler.get` & `handler.set`
- Similar concept: https://github.com/nx-js/observer-util
    - It doesn't use RxJS
    - Its computed property has no cache at all: https://github.com/tylerlong/choose-a-state-container/blob/master/cache/observer-util.spec.js
- Can we replace array with completely new arr instead? (instead of in-place unshift and splice ...etc)
    - it might be even slower
- There seem to be tooooo many GETs when changing an array
    - issue resolved? especially we are now using transaction
- Change for faster equals/uniq library?
    - fastequal
    - benchmark first
- Not all events need id
    - but now id is really cheap
- removeDuplicateEvents 可能是没必要的。 只要 set 和 get 在出现重复的 event id 的时候统一都取短的那个， 就能解决重复刷新的问题。
- Does transaction events property need to include stale$ in addition to set$ and delete$.
    - I guess yes, when we allow user to do freeform transaction
    - If only transaction with array methods, there is no need to, because those methods should be atomic. It won't cause any stale in the middle.
- Support inheritance?
    - this product supports it: https://medium.com/@solkimicreb/stress-testing-react-easy-state-ac321fa3becf
- Add benchmark to https://github.com/krausest/js-framework-benchmark
- Compare with https://github.com/RisingStack/react-easy-state/tree/master/examples/todo-mvc
- Support built-in objects like `Map`
  - Ref: https://itnext.io/the-ideas-behind-react-easy-state-901d70e4d03e
  - Low priority. JSON compatible data support is sufficient
